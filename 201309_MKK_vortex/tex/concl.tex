\item[1.] Magnon BEC is a good probe for vortices in superfluid $^3$He-B.
\item[2.] We observed dissipation of energy in vortex cores and it is
          in agreement with the theory and with previous measurements
          an higher temperatures.
\item[2.] We also observed periodic dissipation peaks at frequency
          dependence. This effect can be related to vortex cores,
          but the explanation does not exist yet.
