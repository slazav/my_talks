Probing vortex cores with trapped magnon condensates in 3He-B

Trapped Bose-Einstein condensates of magnon quasiparticles in 3He-B
proved to be a convenient and sensitive tool for studying various 3He
properties, such as the spatial distribution (or texture) of the order
parameter or relaxation processes in the zero temperature limit. In this
work we investigate influence of quantized vortices in superfluid 3He-B
on the condensate. In a rotating sample filled with staight vortex lines
we have observed change in the trapping potential for magnon condensate
as well as increase of the condensate relaxation rate. We attribute the
additional relaxation to the dissipation of energy in a subsystem of
fermionic quasiparticles bound to vortex cores. These core-bound
fermions are coupled with the magnon condensate via oscillation of
vortex cores which are non-axisymmetric at the low temperature. The
relaxation rate of the condensate as a function of applied magnetic
field displays a complicated pattern of peaks which in addition depends
on the temperature. We discuss whether this effect can be attributed to
the 'minigap' structure of the energy spectrum of the core-bound
fermions. Such spectrum have been predicted by Caroli, de Gennes and
Matricon in 1964 but has never been experimentally observed.
