I will talk about Hom.Pr.Dom. in He3-B, introductions, 
our plans, our current work which is unfinished unfortunately.

1. He3

First - a short introduction about he3.
He3 is a Fermi liquid which does not freeze down to abs. zero temp.
At 1 mk a superfluid transition occures with a Cooper paring of atoms.
Unlike usual superconductors pairs in He3 have
  spin 1 and orbital momentum 1.
Order parameter is a 3x3 complex matrix wich includes both spin and
orbital degrees of freedom.

Symmetry of this matrix can break in different ways,
There are several superfluid phases in 3He, here is the phase dagram
for small magnetic field. We are working with the B-phase.

Order parameter of the B-phase has this form: if contains a gap,
a phase factor and a rotation matrix wich determins mutual orientation
of spin and orbital spaces.

Superfluid state is degenerate with respect to motion of the phase and
motion of the R matrix. It is four degrees on freedom (you can
parametrize the matrix by three Euler angles, or by axis of rotation and
angle of rotation). And in total we have 18 degrees of freedom,
because it is a 3x3 complex matrix

This means that there are 18 oscillation modes of the order parameter,
four of them are gapless N-G modes. Others are Higgs modes with the gap
of the order of Delta.

One of this NG modes is motion of phase and it is sound.
Motion of R is spin waves and I will talk about it.

======================================================================
2. Texture and spin waves

Motion of the R matrix and Spin is described by Leggett equations.
There is spin, and in magnetic field spin motion is
a normal Larmor precession, affected by this term, some torque
wich comes from a few different interaction energies:
gradient energy, spin-orbit interaction in cooper pairs, interaction
with walls.
Here I wrote OmegaB, so-called Leggett frequency, an important parameter
which shous strength of sp-orb.interaction

Equilibrium distribution or R is texture, and motion of R is
spin waves. Here I am writing r as a function of rotation axis n and
rotation angle theta

For example if we put He3-B in a cylindrical
container at large enough magnetic field we will have a
so-called flare-out texture.
Here arrows show direction of rotation axis n, and rotation angle th
stays at 104 degrees. It corresponds to the minimum of sp-orb int. en.
it is called Leggett angle, an it appears in many places in this theory.

If in NMR experiment we observe small motion of spin near this equilibrium,
for examle here, where n||H, and if Larmor frequency gamma H is
larger then Legg freq, we see three modes:
optical and ac magn are usual for normal larmor precession,
long magnons are unique for He3-B, they have gap OmegaB
they correspond to motion of spin length or oscillation of theta angle.

But these eq are non-linear and if we start increasing NMR pumping
we can switch to some other state. And very interesting state is Hom.Pr.Dom.

======================================================================
3. HPD

Legg Eq. in magn.field have a solution which is drawn here:
In a frame rotating with some angular velocity omega
spin is deflected slightly above 104 degrees (it depends on omega),
and n stays like this.

An important feature of this state is that it is stable in non-uniform
conditions. If some gradient if this precession appears, it creates
spin currents which transfer spin and makes precession uniform.
HPD behaves like a liquid which flows into a region of small magnetic field.

For example to create HPD in CW NMR one can have magn field with a gradient,
apply large enough RF-pumpling and then change the frequency in such a
way that the Larmor cond goes through the cell.
Then HPD appeares in the low-field end and start filling the cell
like this.
In in the NMR spectrometer we see this cureves: 
component of magn parallel to the pump field grows linearly when
HPD is filling the cell, and then stays constant. Transverse magn.
is a dissipation, it is larger here because some dissipation happens in
the domain wall. Then dissipation grows with the freq. shift and when it is
large enough the HPD breaks.

HPD is a good experimental object, it is uniform and coherent, and
NMR signals are large. Many experiments have been done with HPD.
For example, in Moscow in 1987 they used two cells with two HPDs,
connected with a narrow channel.

Thety detune frequencie of both HPDs and observed spin current
flowing throug the channel, and phase slips, and analog of Jos.eff.

In our current project we want to to the same experiment but with a
grathene membrane in the middle of the channel. to see how the superfluidity
is coupled across the membrane, how spin currents can flow.
There is also a theoretical idea about strange fermionic states in this
2D system: graphee immersed in superfluid.

But this experiment is complicated, and it is not clear will we have any results,
so I decided to make a simple preliminary measurement with a single cell.
When cryostat was more or less ready and NMR spectrometer was ready.

THe plan was to see small oscillations on top of the HPD state. We did this
in Moscow in 2004 very briefly and I think that something interesting can
be still found in these area.


======================================================================
5. Experimental cell

The cell is drawn here: It is a stycast cylinder, connected by a narrow channel to
sinter volume of the nuclear stage. There are two pairs of RF coils around the cell,
one for applying excitation, anather for measurements.
There is magnet system, we can apply uniform field, gradient field, quadratic field.
Everything is inside a niobium shield.

We use a dry crystat with nuclear demagnetization. It is not so good and now we are
rebuilding it, but for this wark we managed to do a few short measurements.
And we found something interesting.

======================================================================
6. Measurements

What we measured: here is the cell, and two coils ...

We grow HPD in a usual way, by sweeping magn.field. with some high RF excitation,
but at the same time we are recordind the signal sing the oscilloscope and see what is
happenng not only on the pumping frequency but on other frequencies also.

Here is sliding fft plot. Horiz.axs is time, here it is freq., dashed line shows how
field is changing

...

======================================================================
7. Results

i tryid to classify this modes and I found some interesting dependencied:
In the low freq regime square of the freq. is proportional to freq.shift and
to excittion amplitude (RF-field). Here I plot f^2*exc.volt and  have two lines
for different exc. voltages.

In high-temp mode I have f^2 prop to freq.shift mult by excitation amp.
Here I plot f^2*Uexc. and I have a number of strate lines.

You can see that this lines go to zero at different freq.shifts. And if I change
field gradient, lines start moving. I show it by these red arrows.
This probably means that these oscillations are localized in different parts of the cell.

We still are not sure what are these modes. We had a few ideas, no
we think that we observe a so-called theta-solitons in HPD.

======================================================================
7. Solitons

I did not mention that in such a complicated order parameter one can
have different topological defects. If we have only the superfluid phase,
and it changes by 2pi around some line, we have a vortex.
If we add the rotation matrix, other structures are possible.
Theta-soliton is a boundary, where theta changes by 2pi.

These solitons have been observed in ROTA as a part of so-called spin-mass
vortex (where end of this soliton is sitting on a phase vortex).

To understand the structure of the soliton in HPD it is good to use
n*th cordinates. Then the rotation matrix can be associated with 
a point inside a sphere with radius 180 d. Opposite points of the
sphere correspond to the same state (because rotation by pi and -pi around
the sam axis are equivalent).

There is a sphere with radius 104 degrees which correspond to minimum of
dipolar energy. Phis point is HPD and these tw are equilibrium state
without any precession.

Then we have a path in this sphere where we start
from HPD, go to non-precessing state, cross the boundary, and return back.
This path can be also stable.

As a function of coordinate it looks like this: n and S go to vertical orientation,
then theta changes in this area, then everything goes back.
Size of the soliton core, where theta is changing is small, it is called Dipolar length
and it is about 10 microns. But these tails can be large, their size is proportional
to square root of freq.shift.
We think that we observe oscllations of these objects.

Now I'm doing numerical simulations of Leggett equations in 1D case in rotating frame.
I still do not have good numerical results, but I can see at least something.

======================================================================
8. Numerical simulations

Here you can see a grouth of a usual HPD in CW NMR. These color plots
show orientation of n and S vectors. White and black are two vertical directions and
color is orientation in x-y plane. Horisontal axis is time, and this is the cell length.
I sweep magnetic field at some RF-pumping and I see how HPD is filling the cell.
Components of the total spin go as it should be.

I found that if I sweep field too fast the HPD boundary can be unstable and create a
theta soliton. Here it is 10 times faster sweep, and a soliton with opposite
orientation of n is created (it is the same as jump in theta).
Here HPD is destroyed, by I can create solitons artificially.

Here I plot only magnetization, and you can see these soliton tails. I stabilize the
sliton and make a jump in the magn.field, and I see oscillations.
There is higher frequency which comes from HPD bulk, and lower one which is
localized in the soliton. 

Unfortunately, my calculation is not accurate. I use a fixed grid. size of
the soliton core is much smaller then the grid and it is not calculated properly.
It is just a jump in theta and it is unstable in many cases and it is hard to get anything.
But I'm working on it now.
