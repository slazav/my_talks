Hello, I'll tell you about my PhD work, about measuring of Leggett
frequency in the B-phase of superfluid 3He in aerogel. Feel free to ask
any question at any moment.

First I remember some facts about superfluid 3He. 3He is an isotope of
helium and it stays liquid down to the absolute zero temperature. 3He
atoms are fermions, at about 1 mk they makes cooper pairs and superfluid
transition occur.

Cooper pairs have non-zero spin and non-zero orbital moment. This leads
to rather complicated properties of 3He. For example order parameter of
superfluid transition is a complex matrix 3 by 3. It describes
relationship between spin and orbit spaces of cooper pairs.

3He is a pure substance. No other substance can be solved in 3He at such
temperatures. It is very convenient for experiments. In most cases
experimental results are in a good agreement with the theory of 3He.

It is also interesting to study impure 3He. The only way to do this is
to   put 3He into aerogel. Aerogel consists of silicon oxide strands
with diameter 30-50 Angstrem. Distance between strands is about 1000
Angstrem. It is so-called 98-percent aerogel. Strands occupy only 2
percent of volume. The most experiments was run with 98% aerogel.

====

Here is a photo of aerogel sample in a quartz tube. It is rather fragile
transparent substance with very light weight.

Diameter of aerogel strands is less then superfluid 3He coherence
length. Aerogel can be treated as homogeneous impurity.

====

Here is phase diagram of 3He without aerogel. There is solid phase and
two superfluid phases, A and B. These phases have different type of
order parameter. I'll talk about B-phase.

====

When we put 3He into aerogel phase diagram changes. Superfluid transition
shifts to lower temperature. There are also two phases. Properties of
these phases differ from properties of bulk 3He. For a long time the
structure of these phases haven't been known. Now it is more or less obvious
that these phases are the same as in bulk 3He. All differences are due to
different spatial distribution of order parameter.

===

Now I'll tell about B-phase. Its order parameter is written here.
It consists of energy gap, phase factor, and a matrix 3 by 3 which is
a rotation matrix. We can describe rotation matrix by unity vector n,
the axis of rotation and the angle of rotation theta.

Values of n and theta can vary depending on various things.

Angle theta is set by spin-orbit interaction. Here is energy of this
interaction. It has minimum at theta equals 104 degrees. So theta is
usually close to this value.

It also includes Omega_B parameter which is called Leggett frequency.
So Leggett frequency shows a strength of spin-orbit interaction.

===

Vector n is set by magnetic field and cell walls. For example the distribution
of vector n for a cylindrical cell is shown here.

In the center vector n is parallel to the field direction, and near walls it
deflected at some fixed angle, making some texture of order parameter.

===

Dynamics of order parameter and magnetization described by Leggett
equations. You can see that if theta is 104 degrees, this term is zero
and magnetization precess at Larmor frequency. And if this term is not zero
there is some frequency shift.

When we study Nuclear magnetic resonance in 3He we put it into static
magnetic field and excite oscillations of magnetization by transverse or
longitudinal radio-frequency field. In equilibrium magnetization is
directed along the field, theta angle is 104 degrees and vector n is
deflected by walls as I have told.

There are two modes of small oscillations. One corresponds to transverse
and other to longitudinal resonance. For transverse resonance there is
Larmor frequency and some frequency shift which depends on Leggett
frequency and angle phi between n and magnetic field.

===

If we observe linear transverse resonance in a cylindrical cell, we can
get line shapes of this type: a peak at Larmor frequency which
corresponds to the central part of the cell and a tail for non-zero phi
angle at cell walls.


We can calculate this shape for a given cell. Its horizontal scale
depends on Leggett frequency, so we can measure it. It is the most
convenient way of measuring Leggett frequency.

===

In aerogel things are more complicated. Here you can see two lines for
two similar aerogel samples measured at the same temperature and
pressure. It appears that these samples have different texture,
different angles between n and H. And we don't know what angles
corresponds to these peaks. We can't measure Leggett frequency
without additional information.

Unknown texture strongly complicates the interpretation of most
experiments in 3He in aerogel.

===

Now I'll tell about nonlinear NMR and Homogeneously precessing domain.
Let us put 3He into magnetic field with some gradient. Let the field
increase from top to bottom of the cell. Larmor frequency is also
changes along the cell. Let resonant condition is in some point z_0
inside the cell.

In this environment so-called Homogeneously precessing domain (or HPD)
can exist. In this state magnetization at low-field side is deflected at
angles greater then 104 degrees. Starting from this angle
frequency shift appears. The value of this shift compensate the
difference between Larmor frequency at a given point and exitation
frequency.

Magnetization and order parameter in the whole volume of domain
oscillates homogeneously. There is no texture.

Changing NMR frequency we can move domain boundary along the cell. If we
move it from top to bottom, small domain appears, grows, and fill the
whole cell.

===

NMR line is shown here. Frequency is swept from left to right. In this
point domain appears, then it fills the cell. In this region all the
cell is filled by domain.

With frequency shift increase absorption is also increase and at some
point domain is destroyed. But we can stop at any point and keep domain
for a long time at a given frequency shift.

It have been found that HPD can exist in aerogel and we wanted to study
it to avoid the influence of texture.

======================================================================

Now I proceed to the main part of the work. What have been done.

First we study Leggett equations in our environment. We have static
magnetic field H and rf field lowercase h. We work at rotation frame in
which h is also static. The frequency of the rotation frame is shifted
from Larmor frequency by some value.

We found the equilibrium state of this system. Directions of n and M are
shown here. It is an HPD state. We also found small oscillations around
this equilibrium. There are three modes.

Two of these modes have been found long time ago in the assumption of
zero rf field. We found the new mode with frequency proportional to the
h.

This mode is very interesting. It doesn't depends on frequency shift
delta w, which is not uniform along the cell. In this mode magnetization
oscillates in x-y plane and these oscillations can easily by detected
from usual NMR signal. This mode can be exited by a step change of
static field H.


Then we made some numerical experiments to see these oscillations, to
look how we can excite and detect it, to find some properties of these
oscillations. And then we proceed to the real experiment.

======================================================================

This is experimental cell made of Stycast epoxy. There are two
cameras, one filled with an aerogel sample. We can ran the same
experiments both in bulk 3He and in 3He in aerogel. There is some
volume with heater and thermometers. The cell is cooled down by nuclear
demagnetization cryostat.

We have two coils around each experimental camera: transverse saddle
coils which acts as a reciever and transmitter of NMR signal, and
longitudinal coils used to excite HPD oscillations making step
changes of magnetic field.

===

This is our NMR spectroscopy system. Here is experimental camera with
two coils around it. It is placed into magnetic field with gradient.
Transverse coil is a part of resonant circuit. The circuit is supplied
with a generator, then signal is amplified, compensated and detected at a
NMR frequency by Lock-In generator.

Sweeping the magnetic field we can grow HPD, fill the whole cell by it
and than excite oscillations by a current pulse on a longitudinal coil.
Signal of these oscillations is saved into oscilloscope memory.

===

Here is an example of HPD oscillation signal in bulk 3He. From this
signal we can easily determine frequency of oscillations.

===

Now we can check the correctness of our formula for the frequency.
Frequency should not depend on frequency shift. Here is the ratio of
the measured frequency to the theoretical value for different
frequency shifts. Theoretical values are calculated using known values
of Leggett frequency in bulk 3He. You can see the large region of
shifts there experiment agree with theory.

===

Dependence on RF-field. Here is experimental data, and theoretical
lines without any fitting parameters.

===

Now we can measure temperature dependence of Leggett frequency by our
method and compare it with known values. Our method works well and
we can use it in aerogel.

===

It is an example of oscillation signal in aerogel. We can find its
frequency and calculate Leggett frequency. There is a problem that HPD
in aerogel exists only in a small temperature range. But we can avoid
this problem.

===

As I have told form of linear NMR line depends on texture in the
sample. We don't know this texture, but we know, than horizontal scale
of this line depends on Leggett frequency.  If we found Leggett
frequency at some temperature we can calculate what angles between n
and H corresponds to these peaks. And after that we can determine
Leggett frequency from positions of these peaks at any temperature.

Here is line for our sample. It appears that right peak corresponds to
n perpendicular to H, it is the most possible frequency shift.
This information about texture is sufficient to find Leggett frequency
from this line.

===

Here is results for aerogel. Blue points are found from HPD oscillations,
red points are found from linear NMR using information about texture.
Green line is Leggett frequency for bulk 3He.

So we found new property of 3He, oscillation mode of HPD which can be
used for measuring Leggett frequency. We check this method on bulk 3He
and then apply it to 3He in aerogel where other methods doesn't works
well.
