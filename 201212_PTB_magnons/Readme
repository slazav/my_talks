Trapped magnon condensate in 3He-B

In superfluid 3He-B traps for bosonic magnon excitations can be formed by
the order-parameter texture and the applied profile of the static magnetic
field. At temperatures well below the superfluid transition we pump
magnons to the trap using NMR techniques and create macroscopic occupation
of the ground or of a selected excited level. Such magnons form
Bose-Einstein condensates as demonstrated by the long-lived coherent spin
precession after switching the pumping off.

With decreasing temperature the life time of the magnon condensates
rapidly increases and reaches minutes. We are using this coherent state as
a sensitive tool for studying order parameter structure, relaxation
processes in the zero temperature limit and effects of vortices, including
Majorana fermions bound to vortex cores. In particular, we have found that
the relaxation rate of magnon condensates in a rotating sample filled with
vortex lines demonstrates periodic dependence on the frequency of the
precession. We discuss whether this dependence can be attributed to the
'minigap' structure of the energy spectrum of the bound fermions. Such
spectrum was predicted by Caroli, de Gennes and Matricon in 1964 but has
never been experimentally observed.
