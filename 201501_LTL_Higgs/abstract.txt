Light Higgs channel of magnon BEC decay in 3He-B

Symmetry breaking in 3He-B  has many common features with the
symmetry breaking in particle physics. There are 18 collective modes of
the order parameter in 3He-B, of which  14 are the high-energy
amplitude modes -- analogs of the heavy Higgs bosons, and 4 are the
low-energy Nambu-Goldstone (NG) bosons (sound + 3 spin wave
modes). One of the spin wave modes acquires small mass due to a tiny
spin-orbit interaction, and becomes equivalent to the light Higgs boson
in the composite Higgs scenarios.  In applied magnetic field, the other
two spin wave modes split into the gapped mode (magnon, or optical
magnon) and the gapless NG mode with quadratic dispersion (acoustic
magnon). Here we report the experimental observation of resonant
parametric decay of a Bose-Einstein condensate of optical magnons into
pairs of light Higgs bosons and into pairs of acoustic magnons. In
addition we can see a direct transition between optical and acoustic
magnons.
