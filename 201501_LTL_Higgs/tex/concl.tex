\item[1.] 
Three spin wave modes in $^3$He-B form the analog of the
little Higgs vector field. The role of the interaction, which explicitly
violates the global spin-rotation symmetry, is played by tiny spin-orbit
coupling. The longitudinal spin wave is an analog of the light Higgs
boson. Two others are optical and acoustic magnons.
\item[2.]
We observed the interplay of the all three spin wave modes
in the experiment: a parametric decay of BEC of optical magnons
into light Higgs bosons or into acoustic magnons. Direct
excitation of acoustic magnons have been also observed in presence
of vortices.
\item[3.]
A possibility of excitation and detection of acoustic magnons can open a
new research direction, a study of a $^3$He sample with the short spin
waves, which can be controlled by non-uniform magnetic field and the
texture. The parametric excitation of light Higgs bosons gives us a good
method to measure Leggett frequency.
